# Deep-Learning-ONU
The repository is made to store projects during the course of Deep Learning in Odesa National I.I.Mechnikov University. 


## Lab 1 

In lab 1 I've done a realisation of the activation functions and loss functions. Also, I draw graphs of the activation functions and thir derivatives. I draw graphs of loss functions, as well.  

## Lab 2 

In lab 2 I created a Parameter class (prototype for the neuron), with functions of activation performed in lab 1 and backpropagation function.
Also, I made a gradient descent function for one step( similar to the implication in Pytorch)

## Lab 3 

In lab 3 I created MLP class using PyTorch and tested it on the sklearn dataset called blobs. The data set is made for classification task and it has 3 classes.

## Lab 3-4 

In the lab, I combined lab 3 and the task from 4 and modified it a bit. In the result, I checked for my data set which of the MLP classes( with batch norm, without batch norm, and with batch norm and dropout performed better). To perform the test I made modified MLP class with batch norm and dropout realisation.
